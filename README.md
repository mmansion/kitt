A biologically inspirated creative coding toolkit for making art.

*NOTE: The project is currently in very early stages and will probably break a lot--though that's not the intention. However the architecture will eventually firm up and be hopefully useful for others.*

Cyto is an evolving project that borrows is ideas and DNA from a host of popular open source projects, assimilating features and blending functionality into a unique set of tools focused on creative media-based applications and networked-based performance. 

*NOTE: Most of the code is quite novel, but there is a good deal of assimilated patterns, integrated methods and ported code, as well as influences from many other types of tools and artworks. It is important to place credit where credit is due, so an ongoing list of inspirations and accreditations can be [found here](CREDITS.md).*
