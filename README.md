Cyto is DNA for building a range of creative coding projects, especially works involving net art, digital media, sound, physical computing, robotics, interactive installation and networked-based performance. The project is a chimera of popular libraries and original concepts born of the author's own personal research interests and penchant for making new media artwork. Influences range from a host of remarkable tools and works from around the planet. An an ongoing list of inspirations and credits are listed [here](CREDITS.md).
